Kevin suggests these items to be deleted:

Assets > Prefabs > SceneTransitionProp.prefab
Assets > Scripts > SceneTransitionScript.cs
Assets > Scripts > SceneTransitionScript_v2.cs

Following the above deletions, Kevin proposes the renaming of SceneTransitionScript_v3.cs to SceneTransitionScript.cs, he can handle that later though.

 These are still not done, leave them in.
